# VideoStoreAPI
This Video Store API implementation is based on the Video Store API project that you have previously completed.

## Set Up Notes

You will need to acquire an API key from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) before you can run this project and this includes seeding the database.

## Functionality
